# üöó Line Following Robot using 8051 Microcontroller

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Line Following Robot** using the **8051 microcontroller**. It is an autonomous robot capable of following a predefined path, usually a black line on a white surface or vice versa, using **IR sensors** and basic embedded programming. 

The objective is to explore embedded system concepts, sensor interfacing, and real-time motor control for simple robotics.

## üìù Abstract
The **Line Follower Robot** autonomously follows a marked path by using **infrared (IR) sensors** to detect the line. The **8051 microcontroller** processes signals from the sensors and controls the motors through a motor driver module to adjust the direction. This project integrates both **hardware and software components** for real-time decision-making in line tracking.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Sensor Section:
- **IR sensors** emit infrared light and detect reflection from the surface.
- **Comparator circuit (LM358)** converts analog IR sensor values into digital signals.
- Two comparator outputs (for left and right sensors) are fed to microcontroller **Port P0.0 and P0.1**.

### 2. Control Section:
- The **8051 microcontroller** receives sensor signals.
- Based on sensor input, it processes decisions and sends control signals to the motor driver via **Port P2**.

### 3. Driver Section:
- The **L298N Motor Driver** receives control signals and drives the two DC motors.
- Enables proper voltage/current to motors as 8051 cannot drive motors directly.

## ‚ö° Working Principle

| Sensor Status                     | Robot Behavior        |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Left = 0, Right = 0               | Move **Forward**       |
| Left = 0, Right = 1               | Turn **Left**          |
| Left = 1, Right = 0               | Turn **Right**         |
| Left = 1, Right = 1               | **Stop**               |

- **0** ‚Üí Sensor on black line (low reflection)
- **1** ‚Üí Sensor on white surface (high reflection)
